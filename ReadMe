Known Bugs: None


Files:
    Fast_QR.pdf:
        provides context, describes implementation, summarizes results of experiments
    randomized_QR.cpp:
        implements all functions involved in the various QR decompositions as well as some linear algebra utility functions
    randomized_QR.h:
        header file for randomized_QR.cpp
    main.cpp:
        driver file for the program. Contains many tests of the functions in randomized_QR.cpp as well as various experiments.
    plots.py:
        created the plots used in the reports. Uses data from running main.cpp
    test_eigen.cpp:
        runs tests to determine which of Eigen's functions are parallelized and which are not
    Makefile:
        contains the linker commands to compile the program. Run with "make"



ABOUT EIGEN:
    I did not want to rewrite all the standard linear algebra functions so I am using Eigen. Hopefully this is easy 
    for you to use, but if not, here are some setup instructions that I found helpful. 
        wget -O Eigen.zip https://gitlab.com/libeigen/eigen/-/archive/3.4.0/eigen-3.4.0.zip
        extract the zip and identify the folder that contains the folder entitled "Eigen". It should directly contain the file "Dense"
        add to your compilation command -I "path to Eigen folder"

    EIGEN DOCS:
        it was tough to find something that would load. The first google results did not work for me. After a while,
        I found this documentation (https://libeigen.gitlab.io/docs/GettingStarted.html). I hope it is helpful

    EIGEN PARALLEL OPERATIONS:
        I found that some of the operations in eigen were successfully parallelized, and some were not:
            Matrix-Vector multiplication was not parallelized
            Matrix Subtraction was not parallelized
            Inner Product was not parallelized
            Vector Normalization was not parallelized

            Vector Outer product was parallelized
            Matrix-Matrix product was parallelized

        
        Note that these were just the operations that I tested. To see more detail, see test_eigen.cpp.
